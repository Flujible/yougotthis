# Self-care beyond the hashtags
#### Taylor Elyse Morrison, Ritual builder

57% of working days lost to stress and anxiety?! [Somehow doubt this](http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/causdis/stress.pdf)

In order to care for yourself, you need to listen to your body.
Listen to your body and respond in the most loving way possible.

Listening to your body:
- stillness - Remember: deep breaths help to flush out cortosol (sp?)
- observation - Be consciously aware and observant of your surroundings and you body's input. This helps with reflection on problem causes

Caring for your body:
- rituals - A flexible, caring behaviour that you regularly repeat
-- Your ritual doesnt have to be completely unflexible, keep a core action; take a no screens bath every sunday. If time is running low, adjust to make it quick, skipping it is not self care!
- emergencies - When you're depsarate for some self-care, you should try and have a toolkit with a few techniques to rely on (think of emergency headspaces) for various situations
-- Breath
-- Call a loved one
-- Dance! ðŸ•º
-- Create - do some drawing
-- Write - anything make a list, document your feelings, do what you _need_
-- Give thanks - Tell someone you're greatful for something theyve done
-- 'Pet another creature'
