Needs validation
Can message Jo

## Imposter Syndrome
Feeling that you're not worthy or that you dont deserve to be where you are
Beliving that others are more skilled than you, an dpotentially that you dont deserve your accolades
Struggle feeling pride and joy in achieveents
Pluralistic ignorance - people dont tend to share their mistakes, you dont really hear about how people asked for help etc
Peers are more intelligent/managed to trick them into believing im as good as they are

Perfectionism:
- flawlessness
- high standards
- self criticism
- concern of other's opinions
- catastrophic thinking - beliveing that good (but not awesome) work is not good enough
- Disregarding accomplishments as its hard to feel proud of what you've done and see it for a good piece of work

Gary    - Can you not figure out how to start? (perfectionism)
        - Shame about asking for help
        - Perfectionism can be a reason for procrastination - related to letting people down

Its important to have down time - you need to stop working

## Battling imposter syndrome

Give yourself time (but set a goal for when to start again) - taking time away from problem can help

SMART goals - even in personal projects
"Perfect is the enemy of great"

You are your own worst critic

Try to think of logical outcomes rather than emotionally charged outcomes

Its ok to talk about it, dont be afraid to ask for help

## Anxiety

This is normal but becomes problematic when feeling for a long time

Anxiety and depression can form  a viscious cycle. Self compassion can help with this

Insecurity can often lead to desires for external validation, but the feeling of validation gained here is fleeting; look for validation elsewhere

If you recognise some of this bad behaviour, acknowledge and consider it with an aim of reflection and to gain understanding as to why you are feeling like this

Try to make small, impactful changes - check your emails, then turn your phone off

Reflect more often (each day?) to help recognise and come to terms with how you feel

Scheduling work and rest can help

Learn what helps you calm down, and _DO IT_
