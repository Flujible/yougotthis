## Juniors
Everyone starts as a junior

Only 1 qualified person for every 13 STEM jobs

Getting out of your comfort zone is when you start to stretch yourself
The stretch zone is the prime space to be learning, but be careful not to go too far

Starting to teach others can be sign that you're moving on from being a junior

When going for promotion and interviews, its the items outside your main work role that will stand out

Celebrate your achievements. Stopping and appreciating that you've done something cool. Reward yourself for your accomplishments

Collect evidence of your personal growth. This 'portfolio' will help remind yourself of all the great things you've accomplished and can help with promotions or new jobs. This can also help with imposters syndrome. You cant be that bad if you've done all this stuff! (Thanks Scary!)

Work with an idea to perfecting your craft. Look back at work and see if you can find better ways to do things

Develop your T shape; people should have a core knowledge with two branches to give them some diversity and added value

Things to develop and make notes of success:
- Hard skills
- Communication
- Proactivity
- Giving and recieving feedback
- Team work

## Supporters
Its important to invest time  in your juniors. Consciously set aside time to plan careers

Having a mentor to ask questions to can be very beneficial

If you want to be a mentor, you want people to feel comfortable approaching you

If you're in a pairing that doesnt work for you, make yourself heard. If you let juniors drive then it will help them learn faster than just showing them

Ask the junior questions as well to ensure they have understanding of what is happening when you're working together

You want opportunities to develop your weaker areas

Use a skills chart to set out what you want to achieve and how you feel you are meeting those goals currently. This will help you to find and create opportunities to develop in weaker areas

Feedback is important. Feedback helps to validate where you are and understand people's perspecive of you

Feedback format (in a star shape)
- do more
- do less
- start doing
- stop doing
- keep doing
