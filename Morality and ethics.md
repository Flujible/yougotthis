# Morality and Ethics
#### Sam Warner

A basic interpretation of ethical software is something that doesnt make the world any worse

Ideally, software will impact a large number of people in an overwhelmingly good way!

How do you measure ethics?

Not a lot of devs believe they are responsible for the creation of unethical software

This one was a bit boring, sorry
