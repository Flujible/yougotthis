# You know nothing, (or do you?)
#### Sascha Wolf, Full stack dev & TSA @wolf4earth

## Knowledge sharing
The number of new technologies and information available on the internet can be intimidating and lead to a feeling of not knowing enough

Trying to keep learning because you feel like you dont know enough is oftentimes to avoid embarassment (from being wrong?)
This can cause you to procrastinate; avoid doing a talk, answering the stack overflow question, etc. 

There is no end, there is no point where you can say 'ok now im qualified to answer that question'

Exhaustion can lead to depression; finding it hard to motivate yourself to do things
Therapy could help with this; it helped Sascha develop a new frame of mind

A person is more than the sum of their parts, you cant just focus on their skill at a particular topic/subject

What qualities do you respect about people? We're more than a tech stack, the soft skills are not something to be ignored

Google's project Aristotle aimed to find what made a successful team. They found that psychological safety (the feeling of acceptance from the team and that they wont be berated for speaking out).  It's often the people with the best soft skills that make the best teams. 

Its not just tech that experiences the benefits from good soft skills (maybe they should be core skills then!)

People gain skills from everything they do in their life and these should not be ignored

Tweet Sascha about what you learnt from dancing

Your value is not defined by your tech skills

Try asking people what they would ask you if they needed help. Why would someone come to you for help? This can help you to realise what people's opinions of you are and what impressions you have made on people.
Remember people's impressions can be wrong, so perhaps yours are too. 
When you open an old project/file see if you can identify what you've learnt since you wrote it
Try and document your journey, this could make a for a cool blog post
