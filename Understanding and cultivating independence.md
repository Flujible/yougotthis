# Understanding and cultivating independence
#### Violet Pena, Senior developer

Independence can be understood as the ability to construct and understand solutions

Being independent doesnt always mean being alone

- have a plan
- be honest
- use your tools

## Have a plan
In order to solve a problem, you need to understand it. Understanding a problem is super important, so ask questions!
Planning is good, tracking your work is better
TDD!

## Be honest
Its important to be aware of how you are performing and be with yourself about it
- I am having trouble solving  this
- I am going to need more time
- I will try a different approach 

## Use your tools
- Pen and paper offers much more freedom, so dont forget about it!
- Rubber ducking helps you to realise mistakes and assumptions that could be causing you problems (I wonder if the vocalising part is necessary)
- Find a related problem to help with solutions. Find if problems are related by looking at data, unknowns, and conditions
- ASK FOR HELP. It shows that you know your limits, respect your colleagues, and value your work above your ego

Who do you ask for help?
- teammates
- SMEs

When do you ask for help?
- when you cant do thing

How do you ask for help?
- Give context to help people understand your position
- Ask a _specific_ question, if you dont think you can perhaps you've not analysed the problem enough
- something i missed
- say thanks
