# The transformative power of junior developers
#### Sam Morgan, Head of education @ makers

The word 'junior' has implications. It suggests you have to be young, early carreer and are not expected to deliver. It also suggests hierarchy; if someone with more experience challenges you as a junior, then their idea will often trump yours.

The issue with 'junior' is that developers are all hired to solve the same sorts of problems, and there will always be a 'junior' that knows more about something than you do, so why should they get shitty pay when they will be more effective than the senior (I dont completely agree with this tho)

Developer is probably a better term

Context is supremely important when trying to solve a problem
Context is anything that ties your work to _why_ the work is being done. What impact does it have to the rest of the system, or to the users, etc?

High expectations tend to lead to high levels of learning.

Everything is an exercise. When executing(?) an exercise, think about time, unblocking people, keywords which might prompt answers and encouragement

There are a lot of great articles online which can help with exercise. Prep exercises can help here as well. If you are working with a learner and know they will face a particular problem, perhaps give them a similar challenge beforehand

When you help someone, you take away their opportunity to learn the answer by themselves. Try and guide them towards answers rather than just hand them out

Build a library of questions that you have asked or been asked to gain a library of useful information you can pass down to people. This sounds like a great idea for handovers

Tutorials sound great, but they inhibit being able to learn how to do the thing in an extensible way. You may find you cant do the thing that the tutorial helped with when you _no longer have the tutorial to hand_. This means you havent learnt enough!

Try not to teach concretes (i.e. syntax of a function) and instead try to teach concepts. There are plenty of resources online which will teach concretes, and arguably better than you can (not sure I aggree with this either)

Feedback should have some sort of structure. PRs are a feedback structure, as are standups, retrospectives, etc

Require feedback intentionally. Have an idea of what you want feedback on, try not to ask generally or you might get advise that isnt very useful to you.

Try to keep feedback concise, and expect itterations. If you give feedback and you dont see it implemented, perhaps you didnt communicate it properly, or perhaps they disagree with your feedback. Talk to people.

Creating change when you are new is not an easy task, and people will push back
